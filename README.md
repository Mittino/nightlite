NightLite (https://mittino-nightlight.herokuapp.com/) is an application to help stargazers find good locations to view the stars! It also educates users about the impacts of light-pollution and the ability to see the stars.

This was a Galvanize Q2 Group Project.

The homepage shows a great example of a location to view the stars:

When you click 'explore' you can get more information about light pollution and see two maps showing light pollution. The maps are being imported from the ESRI Map Database.

Below the map users see the detailed information on the locations and can add a comment:

When users click 'view comments' a popup of the comments for that location are displayed:

At the top of the observation list, under the map, users can click 'create an observation' to bring them to a new page where they can input a new location:

Users can also click on 'Update My Comments' to view a list of their comments where they can edit the comment or delete the comment.
